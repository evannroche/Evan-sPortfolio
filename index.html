            <p>
              Of all the professions out there only one stands out to me, Computer Science. My goal is to graduate from a college with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With a bachelors in Computer Science I have more opportunities for jobs. One job I am currently exploring is being a Software Developer. <br> </p>

              <p>I have noticed that Software Developers need 3 important skills, problem solving skills, efficiency, and excellent math skills. I have learned many skills like these such as, problem solving, which help me become a better programmer. Being a team member in a robotics team has helped me learn more about problem solving and steps to problem solve. We always find problems with our robot and try to fix it. <br> </p>

              <p>Outside of computer science I have participated in many chess tournaments and vex robotics competitions. Every year I participate in the Super States Chess Competition in Santa Clara. All my experiences have taught me more of what is needed to become a Computer Scientist. These experiences have taught me more about problem solving, teamwork and other important skills. <br> </p>

              <p>All in all I hope to learn more about Computer Science and develop new skills that will help me become a better Computer Scientist. Thank you for your time.</p>
