            The purpose of this project is to introduce students to Github and programming together through branches. This project introduced me to a new way to code with a big team and overall helped me to get ready for the work force.

          In this project both my partner and I were tasked with figuring out if a fish tank’s software was secure or not and if the fish tank was hacked. We used the Scrum process to distribute tasks and make sure we get our work done in time to be done by the deadline. We created Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives to find out what went well and what we could improve on in both our documentation and our code. We also created a video and program code showcasing our final product and solution. To do this we analyzed the data given to us through emails and took note of anything that look suspicious. After that we analyzed the fish tank’s code to find anything out of the ordinary to eventually find the problem with the fishtanks. You can view our Client Report here.

          I created this project to meet 6 main requirements for the AP CSP 2022 Create Task created by College Board. In this program I created a Pacman game where the user moves around an object trying to collect as many dots as possible while trying to get the shortest time possible. The program starts off with 3, 2, 1 where the user is disable and unable to do anything until the timer starts. The the user is free to move around the board except anywhere a blue line, or wall, is located. The user then tries to collect as many dots as possible while beating their previous high score or creating a new high score. This game was created using python and had to meet 6 main requirements.

      The purpose of this project was to create a program that leads the robot from the starting position to the end. There are a total of nine grids split between my partner and I, so we both had to create one program that works for four different grids. We decided to create different functions for each grid and when it runs it would call the grid that was given. One of the biggest problems we had was trying to make our code more abstract. Both our programs were very long to work for four grids. To solve this we created functions for repeated code and called those functions when the code was needed. My partner and I stayed in touch throughout the project to work on the problems and discuss possible changes in future sprints.

      Project: Python COVID Escape Room<br>
      Course: Computer Science Essentials(CSE)<br>

      The purpose of the project was to create an Escape Room with a Covid theme. My role in this project was to create the questions 3, 4 and to create the background function. My partner and I decided to create a storyline where the user has to climb a mountain to reach to Covid vaccine which is located at the top of the mountain. On the way to the top the user would have to pass obstacles or answer Covid related questions. My partner and I stayed in contact throughout the project to make sure we communicated any errors or changes we were making in the project. We faced many challenges while creating the escape room but the main problem was the questions being too hard. We brainstormed ways to fix this idea and decided to fix it by not changing the question but by adding a hint for question four and an alternate question for question 3.
