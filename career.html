        <p>
            <p class="explore">During me time in highschool I have gained experience through different clubs and classes I particapated in. I have been in two computer science related classes, CSE (Computer Science Essentials) and AP CSP (AP Computer Science Princples). Both of these classes I have imporved my computer science skills as well as my teamwork skills. Both classes have taught me important skills like the Scrum Process preparing me for the jobs in the real world where they acutally use these different processes. Outside of school I have been part of two main clubs, the Chess Club and the Robotics Club. </p>

              <p>
                
                <p>In the chess club I was the Online Tournament Director where I learned important communication skills in order to properly manage and create tournaments. This was a huge time commitment but it was worth it because I got to create the NorCal Invitational 2022 where I contacted many different schools and got Quarry Lane, DHS, FMS, and Mavin Academy to participate in one big tournament. This tournament greatly improved my communication skills because I was tasked to contact different schools and find different schools to play against. I also learned a lot about advertising, in order to make the tournament actually occur I spent a lot of time advertising through different sites and servers. </p>

              <p>
                <p>Along with the chess club I am also in the Robotics Club. In the robotics club I spend a lot of time learning new things as well as teaching new things. I went into the club not knowing a thing about Robotics and a bit about computer science from CSE. I was then thought the basics and robots and drafted on a team. In the team I learned a lot about programming a robot and working with a team in real life. This has helped prepare me for the real work where I may be given a time limit, a task and a team to work with. All these different experiences really helped improve my skill sets and overall konwledge to help me enter the field of computer science prepared.</p>
